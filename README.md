# Digital-Marketing-Campaign
### Project Overview 📝
This project analyzes the effectiveness of various digital marketing campaigns using customer-level data. The goal is to uncover insights about campaign performance, customer behavior, and engagement metrics to help optimize marketing strategies.<br>
Using Poer Bi, I created interactive visualizations to answer critical question such as: <br>
* How do Click-Through Rates and Conversion Rates varry across different campaign channels? <br>
* Do more Social Shares leads to higher Conversion Rate? <br>
* Which age-group shows the highest engagement and loyalty?
### Insights Summary 📌
**In order to evaluate campaign performance, we focused on the following metrics:** <br>
* **Click through Rate**: The percent of people who see a campaign and clicks on the associated link. <br>
* **Conversion Rate**: The percent of people who perform a desired action e.g. buying a product. <br>
* **Cost per Acquisition**: Total cost of acquiring each new customer.<br>
* **Average Time on Site**: Average time spend by customer on website. <br>
* **Click to Open Rate**: The percentage of people who opened an email and also clicked on a link within it.
### Visual Insights 📊
1. **Engagement Metrics**
   <br>**Do More Social Shares Lead to Higher Conversion Rates?** <br> <br>

   <br> More social shares leads to do not necessarily lead to higher conversion rates. Social shares have little to no measurable effect on conversion rate across all campaign channels.

2. **Cost Efficiency**
   <br>**What’s the Cost per Acquisition by age group and how can it be optimized?** <br> <br>

   <br>
   * The Pre-Retirement (55–64) and Mid Career (35–44) segments offer the highest conversion rates (10.70% and 10.52%) with the lowest CPA ($5.6K). <br> 
   * The Early Professional have lowest conversion rate (10.23%) with highest Cost per Acquisition ($5.9K). <br>

3. **Campaign Performance Analysis**
   <br> **How does ad spend relate to conversion rate or click-through rate across channels?** OR 
   <br> **Which campaign channel (Email, PPC, Social Media) has the highest conversion rate?**

   <br>
   * PPC has the highest CTR (15.83%) indicating it attracts the most clicks - possibly due to visibilty or targeting. However, its conversion rate is only 10.41%. <br>
   * Social Media is the top performer in Conversion Rate (10.66%), suggesting it is more effective at converting traffic into customers, even with lower CTR than PPC. <br>
   * Email Campaigns perform consistently well, ranking second-highest in both CTR and CR. This makes it a reliable and balanced channel. <br>
   * SEO and Referral have the lowest CTR and CR, suggesting lower performance overall, but still very close in percentage—marginal difference.
 
5. **Age-Based Analysis**
   <br> **Which age groups have the highest loyalty and purchase history, and how should loyalty programs be targeted?** <br> <br>
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30708f73-10fc-4979-a3c6-b176b0b43e06)

   (i) Mid Career (35–44):
   * High loyalty and purchase behavior.
   * Best group for loyalty incentives, referrals, or early-access offers.
   (ii) 45–54 & 25–34:
   * High purchase history, but relatively less loyalty point accumulation.
   * Consider promotional nudges or personalized loyalty campaigns to build stickiness.
   (iii) 55–64:
   * Well-balanced in both dimensions.
   * A stable customer segment worth nurturing.
   (iv) 18–24 & 65+:
   * Lower purchase and loyalty levels.
   * Use targeted acquisition strategies or lighter loyalty efforts here.  
6. **Time Engagement**
   <br> **Which age groups spend the most time on site, and how might that relate to conversion potential?** <br>
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14d43d3f-8b0e-4a62-8b80-5aac41c9b318)
   <br>
   * Mid Career (35–44) and Experienced Professionals (45–54) spend the most time on site (12.4K and 12.1K seconds respectively), suggesting high engagement. <br>
   * Young Adults (18–24) and Retired individuals spend the least time (8K and 5.8K), indicating lower engagement or quicker exits.
### Insights
<br> 1. 🎯 Focus investment on age groups 35–44 and 55–64: <br>
They offer high conversion, low CPA, and strong engagement. <br>
Mid Career (35–44) has high loyalty and purchase behavior.
<br> 2. 🧪 Test and refine approach for 18–24 and 65+: <br>
Their lower time on site suggests reduced interest or poor experience. <br>
Consider UX improvements, relevance of messaging, or content changes.
<br> 3. 📉 Reevaluate spending on 25–34: <br>
Despite decent engagement, it has the lowest conversion and highest CPA. Also, has lower purchase and loyalty levels.
### Recommendations
* Double down on Social Media: It brings in solid traffic and converts the best. Consider scaling content and ad spend here. <br>
* While PPC has the highest CTR, the conversion rate doesn’t match — review landing pages, audience targeting, or ad messaging. <br>
* Shift targeting and budget toward high-converting age segments (especially 55–64 and 35–44) to improve ROI. <br>
* Consider custom messaging or creative testing for younger segments to raise conversion without increasing CPA. <br>
* Use targeted acquisition strategies or lighter loyalty efforts for 18-24.
