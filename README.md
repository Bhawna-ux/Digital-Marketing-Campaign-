# Digital-Marketing-Campaign
### Project Overview 📝
This project analyzes the effectiveness of various digital marketing campaigns using customer-level data. The goal is to uncover insights about campaign performance, customer behavior, and engagement metrics to help optimize marketing strategies.<br>
Using Poer Bi, I created interactive visualizations to answer critical question such as: <br>
* How do Click-Through Rates and Conversion Rates varry across different campaign channels? <br>
* Do more Social Shares leads to higher Conversion Rate? <br>
* Which age-group shows the highest engagement and loyalty?
### Insights Summary 📌
**In order to evaluate campaign performance, we focused on the following metrics:** <br>
* **Click through Rate**: The percent of people who see a campaign and clicks on the associated link. <br>
* **Conversion Rate**: The percent of people who perform a desired action e.g. buying a product. <br>
* **Cost per Acquisition**: Total cost of acquiring each new customer.<br>
* **Average Time on Site**: Average time spend by customer on website. <br>
* **Click to Open Rate**: The percentage of people who opened an email and also clicked on a link within it.
### Visual Insights 📊
1. **Engagement Metrics**
   <br>**Do More Social Shares Lead to Higher Conversion Rates?** <br> <br>

   <br> More social shares leads to do not necessarily lead to higher conversion rates. Social shares have little to no measurable effect on conversion rate across all campaign channels.

2. **Cost Efficiency**
   <br>**What’s the Cost per Acquisition by age group and how can it be optimized?** <br> <br>

   <br> * The Pre-Retirement (55–64) and Mid Career (35–44) segments offer the highest conversion rates (10.70% and 10.52%) with the lowest CPA ($5.6K).
   <br> * The Early Professional have lowest conversion rate (10.23%) with highest Cost per Acquisition ($5.9K). <br>
   <br>**What’s the Cost per Acquisition by campaign type and how can it be optimized?** <br>

5. **Age-Based Analysis**
   
### Recommendations
* Shift targeting and budget toward high-converting age segments (especially 55–64 and 35–44) to improve ROI.
* Consider custom messaging or creative testing for younger segments to raise conversion without increasing CPA.
