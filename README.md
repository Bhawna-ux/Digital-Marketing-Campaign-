# Digital-Marketing-Campaign
### Project Overview 📝
This project analyzes the effectiveness of various digital marketing campaigns using customer-level data. The goal is to uncover insights about campaign performance, customer behavior, and engagement metrics to help optimize marketing strategies.<br>
Using Poer Bi, I created interactive visualizations to answer critical question such as: <br>
* How do Click-Through Rates and Conversion Rates varry across different campaign channels? <br>
* Do more Social Shares leads to higher Conversion Rate? <br>
* Which age-group shows the highest engagement and loyalty?
### Insights Summary 📌
**In order to evaluate campaign performance, we focused on the following metrics:** <br>
* **Click through Rate**: The percent of people who see a campaign and clicks on the associated link. <br>
* **Conversion Rate**: The percent of people who perform a desired action e.g. buying a product. <br>
* **Cost per Acquisition**: Total cost of acquiring each new customer.<br>
* **Average Time on Site**: Average time spend by customer on website. <br>
* **Click to Open Rate**: The percentage of people who opened an email and also clicked on a link within it.
