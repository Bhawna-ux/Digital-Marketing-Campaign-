# Digital-Marketing-Campaign
### Project Overview üìù
This project analyzes the effectiveness of various digital marketing campaigns using customer-level data. The goal is to uncover insights about campaign performance, customer behavior, and engagement metrics to help optimize marketing strategies.<br>
Using Poer Bi, I created interactive visualizations to answer critical question such as: <br>
* How do Click-Through Rates and Conversion Rates varry across different campaign channels? <br>
* Do more Social Shares leads to higher Conversion Rate? <br>
* Which age-group shows the highest engagement and loyalty?
This analysis provides a data-driven understanding of how users interact with different digital campaigns. It highlights:
* Which channels and age groups are most cost-effective.
* How engagement metrics like social shares and time on site relate to conversions.
* Where marketing efforts can be optimized for better ROI.
### Key Metrics üìå
**In order to evaluate campaign performance, we focused on the following metrics:** <br>
* **Click through Rate (CTR)**: The percent of people who see a campaign and clicks on the associated link. <br>
* **Conversion Rate (CR)**: The percent of people who perform a desired action e.g. buying a product. <br>
* **Cost per Acquisition (CPA)**: Total cost of acquiring each new customer.<br>
* **Average Time on Site**: Average time spend by customer on website. <br>
* **Click to Open Rate (CTOR)**: The percentage of people who opened an email and also clicked on a link within it.
### Visual Insights üìä
1. **Cost Efficiency**
   <br>**What‚Äôs the Cost per Acquisition by age group and how can it be optimized?** <br> <br>

   <br>
   * The Pre-Retirement (55‚Äì64) and Mid Career (35‚Äì44) segments offer the highest conversion rates (10.70% and 10.52%) with the lowest CPA ($5.6K). <br> 
   * The Early Professional have lowest conversion rate (10.23%) with highest Cost per Acquisition ($5.9K).
   
   **What‚Äôs the Cost per Acquisition by campaign type and how can it be optimized?**

   <br>
   * All channels are relatively close in cost (within about $200 difference), suggesting no extreme outliers but still offering room for cost optimization. <br>
   * PPC (Pay-Per-Click) has the lowest cost per acquisition at $5,612.07 and highest CTR (15.83%), making it the most cost-effective channel among the five. <br>
   * Email marketing has the highest cost per acquisition, at $5,809.28, indicating it is the least cost-efficient channel in this comparison.
2. **Campaign Performance Analysis**
   <br> **How does ad spend relate to conversion rate or click-through rate across channels?** OR 
   <br> **Which campaign channel (Email, PPC, Social Media) has the highest conversion rate?**
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/410f731b-8591-4836-8a72-78bbe70869a5)
   <br>
   * PPC has the highest CTR (15.83%) indicating it attracts the most clicks - possibly due to visibilty or targeting. However, its conversion rate is only 10.41%. <br>
   * Email and Social Media channels drive good engagement ($5,809.28 and $5,718.21), but at a higher cost (15.56% and 15.55%), indicating room for optimization. <br>
   * Refferal is not strong in either market, making it a lower performing channel. <br>
   * SEO indicates relatively poor engagement (CPA $5,696.03, CR 15.32%)
 
3. **Age-Based Analysis**
   <br> **Which age groups have the highest loyalty and purchase history, and how should loyalty programs be targeted?** <br> <br>
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30708f73-10fc-4979-a3c6-b176b0b43e06)

   (i) Mid Career (35‚Äì44):
   * High loyalty and purchase behavior.
   * Best group for loyalty incentives, referrals, or early-access offers.
   (ii) 45‚Äì54 & 25‚Äì34:
   * High purchase history, but relatively less loyalty point accumulation.
   * Consider promotional nudges or personalized loyalty campaigns to build stickiness.
   (iii) 55‚Äì64:
   * Well-balanced in both dimensions.
   * A stable customer segment worth nurturing.
   (iv) 18‚Äì24 & 65+:
   * Lower purchase and loyalty levels.
   * Use targeted acquisition strategies or lighter loyalty efforts here.
   <br> **Which age group shows the best conversion efficiency relative to their click-through rate?** OR <br>
   **Are younger users (18‚Äì34) engaging without converting? Should messaging be adjusted for this demographic?** <br>
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cbb6d7a-28f0-4299-9426-e7bc5f3e46d7)
   <br>
   * Although early professionals consists high CTR (15.41%) but they have low Conversion Rate (10.23%). <br>
   * On the other hand, Pre-Retirement age group performs best in terms of both CTR (15.30%) and CR (10.70%).

4. **Time Engagement**
   <br> **Which age groups spend the most time on site, and how might that relate to conversion potential?** <br>
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14d43d3f-8b0e-4a62-8b80-5aac41c9b318)
   <br>
   * Mid Career (35‚Äì44) and Experienced Professionals (45‚Äì54) spend the most time on site (12.4K and 12.1K seconds respectively), suggesting high engagement. <br>
   * Young Adults (18‚Äì24) and Retired individuals spend the least time (8K and 5.8K), indicating lower engagement or quicker exits.
  
 5. **Engagement Metrics**
   <br>**Do More Social Shares Lead to Higher Conversion Rates?** <br> <br>
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edca58ca-d198-46d1-8d09-9f81a9e2a49e)  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e98adc99-bf6e-4787-891a-7b052dace490)
   <br> More social shares leads to do not necessarily lead to higher conversion rates. Social shares have little to no measurable effect on conversion rate across all campaign channels.
### Insights
1. More Social Share do not lead to more conversion rates. There's is no correlation across campaign channels.
2. Pre-Retirement (55-64) and Mid-Career (35-44) segments offers the best CPA and CR balance.
3. PPC is the most cost-effective (lowest CPA, highest CR). <br>
4. Email marketing is the least cost-effective, with the highest CPA.
5. Referral and SEO underperform across most metrics.
6. 35‚Äì44 (Mid Career) are highly loyal and high spenders. Whereas, 18‚Äì24 & 65+ are low in both.
7. 35‚Äì54 segments spend the most time on site, correlating with higher loyalty and conversions. However, 18‚Äì24 and 65+ have the shortest visits, indicating weak engagement or misaligned content.
### Recommendations ‚úÖ
* Prioritize ad spend on 35‚Äì64 age groups for acquisition and loyalty programs. <br>
* Consider custom messaging or creative testing for younger segments to raise conversion without increasing CPA. <br>
* Increase budget allocation for PPC, continue optimizing targeting, but improve landing page optimization for higher CR. <br>
* Refine Email/Social strategies ‚Äì test creative, timing, and user journeys.
* Improve SEO Engagement. Enhance content quality, keyword targeting, and descriptions to boost visibility and clicks. <br>
* Shift targeting and budget toward high-converting age segments (especially 55‚Äì64 and 35‚Äì44) to improve ROI. <br>
* Use targeted acquisition strategies or lighter loyalty efforts for 18-24.
* For 35‚Äì54, promote deeper site journeys: product demos, guides, loyalty programs.
* For younger users, redesign experience to be faster, mobile-optimized, and visually engaging.
* For older audiences, test simplified navigation and clearer CTAs.
