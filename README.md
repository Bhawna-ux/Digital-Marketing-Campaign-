# Digital-Marketing-Campaign
### Project Overview 📝
This project analyzes the effectiveness of various digital marketing campaigns using customer-level data. The goal is to uncover insights about campaign performance, customer behavior, and engagement metrics to help optimize marketing strategies.<br>
Using Poer Bi, I created interactive visualizations to answer critical question such as: <br>
* How do Click-Through Rates and Conversion Rates varry across different campaign channels? <br>
* Do more Social Shares leads to higher Conversion Rate? <br>
* Which age-group shows the highest engagement and loyalty?
### Insights Summary 📌
**In order to evaluate campaign performance, we focused on the following metrics:** <br>
* **Click through Rate**: The percent of people who see a campaign and clicks on the associated link. <br>
* **Conversion Rate**: The percent of people who perform a desired action e.g. buying a product. <br>
* **Cost per Acquisition**: Total cost of acquiring each new customer.<br>
* **Average Time on Site**: Average time spend by customer on website. <br>
* **Click to Open Rate**: The percentage of people who opened an email and also clicked on a link within it.
### Visual Insights 📊
1. **Engagement Metrics**
   <br>**Do More Social Shares Lead to Higher Conversion Rates?** <br> <br>

   <br> More social shares leads to do not necessarily lead to higher conversion rates. Social shares have little to no measurable effect on conversion rate across all campaign channels.

2. **Cost Efficiency**
   <br>**What’s the Cost per Acquisition by age group and how can it be optimized?** <br> <br>

   <br> * The Pre-Retirement (55–64) and Mid Career (35–44) segments offer the highest conversion rates (10.70% and 10.52%) with the lowest CPA ($5.6K).
   <br> * The Early Professional have lowest conversion rate (10.23%) with highest Cost per Acquisition ($5.9K). <br>

5. **Age-Based Analysis**
6. **Time Engagement**
   <br> **Which age groups spend the most time on site, and how might that relate to conversion potential?** <br>
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/030b14c7-b38a-4c6a-a6ec-7bcfcfd7d67c)
   <br> * Mid Career (35–44) and Experienced Professionals (45–54) spend the most time on site (12.4K and 12.1K seconds respectively), suggesting high engagement. <br>
   * Young Adults (18–24) and Retired individuals spend the least time (8K and 5.8K), indicating lower engagement or quicker exits.
### Insights
<br> 🎯 Focus investment on age groups 35–44 and 55–64: <br>
They offer high conversion, low CPA, and strong engagement. 
<br> 🧪 Test and refine approach for 18–24 and 65+: <br>
Their lower time on site suggests reduced interest or poor experience. <br>
Consider UX improvements, relevance of messaging, or content changes.
<br> 📉 Reevaluate spending on 25–34: <br>
Despite decent engagement, it has the lowest conversion and highest CPA.
### Recommendations
* Shift targeting and budget toward high-converting age segments (especially 55–64 and 35–44) to improve ROI.
* Consider custom messaging or creative testing for younger segments to raise conversion without increasing CPA.
